## TODO:

- Set out site structure
    - pages:
        - index
        - home
        - calendar
        - profile
        - business profile
        - client list
        - settings
        
 - Auth:
    - implement auth checking and limiting routes/functionality

    - components:
        - Layout

 - Use Dialog for popup forms...

## Improvements:
 - Change settingsMenu to use drawer rather than menu
 - logo as SVG

## Future Additions to site:
 - breadcrumbs - mobile view in header - desktop view above page body
 - speed dial for quick access actions when logged in

## Future issues to solve:
 - better method for getting viewport width/user agent for useState in layout to prevent page from rendering twice. some nice user agent solutions to set initial values here:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59494037/how-to-detect-the-device-on-react-ssr-app-with-next-js and here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63928337/css-style-is-not-correctly-being-applied-when-conditional-render-in-react
